  abstract  = "Adaptation and innovation are extremely important to the
               manufacturing industry. This development should lead to
               sustainable manufacturing using new technologies. To promote
               sustainability, smart production requires global perspectives of
               smart production application technology. In this regard, thanks
               to intensive research efforts in the field of artificial
               intelligence (AI), a number of AI-based techniques, such as
               machine learning, have already been established in the industry
               to achieve sustainable manufacturing. Thus, the aim of the
               present research was to analyze, systematically, the scientific
               literature relating to the application of artificial
               intelligence and machine learning (ML) in industry. In fact,
               with the introduction of the Industry 4.0, artificial
               intelligence and machine learning are considered the driving
               force of smart factory revolution. The purpose of this review
               was to classify the literature, including publication year,
               authors, scientific sector, country, institution, and keywords.
               The analysis was done using the Web of Science and SCOPUS
               database. Furthermore, UCINET and NVivo 12 software were used to
               complete them. A literature review on ML and AI empirical
               studies published in the last century was carried out to
               highlight the evolution of the topic before and after Industry
               4.0 introduction, from 1999 to now. Eighty-two articles were
               reviewed and classified. A first interesting result is the
               greater number of works published by the USA and the increasing
               interest after the birth of Industry 4.0.",

  abstract  = "The trend of bringing machine learning (ML) to the Internet of
               Things (IoT) field devices is becoming ever more relevant, also
               reducing the overall energy need of the applications. ML models
               are usually trained in the cloud and then deployed on edge
               devices. Most IoT devices generate large amounts of unlabeled
               data, which are expensive and challenging to annotate. This
               paper introduces the self-learning autonomous edge learning and
               inferencing pipeline (AEP), deployable in a resource-constrained
               embedded system, which can be used for unsupervised local
               training and classification. AEP uses two complementary
               approaches: pseudo-label generation with a confidence measure
               using k-means clustering and periodic training of one of the
               supported classifiers, namely decision tree (DT) and k-nearest
               neighbor (k-NN), exploiting the pseudo-labels. We tested the
               proposed system on two IoT datasets. The AEP, running on the STM
               NUCLEO-H743ZI2 microcontroller, achieves comparable accuracy
               levels as same-type models trained on actual labels. The paper

               frameworks lack important aspects required to keep up with

               architecture of AIfES and the applied design principles.

               Additionally, using AIfES reduces memory consumption by up to
               54\% when using CNNs. Furthermore, we show the performance of
               AIfES during the training of FCNN as well as CNN and demonstrate
