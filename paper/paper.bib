               Things (IoT) field devices is becoming ever more relevant, also
               reducing the overall energy need of the applications. ML models
               are usually trained in the cloud and then deployed on edge
               devices. Most IoT devices generate large amounts of unlabeled
               data, which are expensive and challenging to annotate. This
               paper introduces the self-learning autonomous edge learning and
               inferencing pipeline (AEP), deployable in a resource-constrained
               embedded system, which can be used for unsupervised local
               training and classification. AEP uses two complementary
               approaches: pseudo-label generation with a confidence measure
               using k-means clustering and periodic training of one of the
               supported classifiers, namely decision tree (DT) and k-nearest
               neighbor (k-NN), exploiting the pseudo-labels. We tested the
               proposed system on two IoT datasets. The AEP, running on the STM
               NUCLEO-H743ZI2 microcontroller, achieves comparable accuracy
               levels as same-type models trained on actual labels. The paper
               makes an in-depth performance analysis of the system,

               Machine Learning (ML) into even the smallest embedded devices,
               thus enabling local intelligence in real-world applications,
               e.g. for image or speech processing. Traditional Edge AI
               frameworks lack important aspects required to keep up with
               recent and upcoming ML innovations. These aspects include low
               flexibility concerning the target hardware and limited support

               to overcome these challenges faced by traditional edge AI
               frameworks. In this paper, we give a detailed overview of the
               architecture of AIfES and the applied design principles.
               Finally, we compare AIfES with TensorFlow Lite for
               Microcontrollers (TFLM) on an ARM Cortex-M4-based System-on-Chip
               (SoC) using fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) and
               convolutional neural networks (CNNs). AIfES outperforms TFLM in
               both execution time and memory consumption for the FCNNs.
               Additionally, using AIfES reduces memory consumption by up to
               54\% when using CNNs. Furthermore, we show the performance of
               AIfES during the training of FCNN as well as CNN and demonstrate
